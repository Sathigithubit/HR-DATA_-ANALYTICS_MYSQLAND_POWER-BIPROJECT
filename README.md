### Project Title: **End-to-End HR Data Analysis Using MySQL and Power BI**

### Project Description:

This project focuses on an end-to-end analysis of HR data using MySQL for data extraction, transformation, and Power BI for interactive visualization and reporting. The goal is to provide the HR department with comprehensive insights into key metrics such as employee turnover, performance, diversity, and compensation, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

### Objectives:

1. **Data Extraction and Preparation**:
   - Extract raw HR data from multiple sources, such as employee records, performance reviews, attendance, and compensation details using MySQL.
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing or inaccurate values and ensuring data integrity. 
   - Perform advanced MySQL queries, including joins, to integrate data across multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.

2. **Data Transformation and Analysis**:
   - Utilize MySQL to calculate critical HR metrics, including employee turnover rates, average tenure, and salary distribution across departments.
   - Analyze trends in recruitment, employee satisfaction, and diversity.
   - Segment data by various factors like departments, roles, and locations to generate more focused insights.
   - Use SQL queries to generate summary tables and reports that can feed directly into Power BI for visualization.

3. **Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation**:
   - Import the processed data into Power BI for dashboard creation and dynamic visual reporting.
   - Develop visualizations, including trend charts, bar graphs, and pie charts, to represent metrics such as attrition rates, gender diversity, and employee performance.
   - Utilize Power BI's drill-down and filtering capabilities to enable in-depth analysis and comparisons between departments, job functions, and locations.
   
4. **Reporting and Recommendations**:
   - Generate interactive reports in Power BI to provide management with insights into employee performance, retention risks, and pay structure analysis.
   - Provide actionable recommendations, such as strategies to reduce turnover, improve employee satisfaction, and address potential pay gaps.

### Tools:
